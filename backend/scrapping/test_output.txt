SevenDays® believes the youth of our community have the power to make the world a better place through projects that promote ongoing kindness. Does your kindness project make ripples in the community? Does it encourage others to gain knowledge, change their mindset and have more kind behaviors? How is it continuing kindness once you have completed the project?
ADVERTISEMENT

We challenge you to be a force for good. SevenDays® has seven themes: Love, Discover, Others, Connect, You, Go, and Onward. We are looking for high school seniors who will take one or more of these seven themes and apply them to a lasting project that will start a ripple to change the world.

On April 13, 2014, Dr. William Corporon, Reat Underwood, and Terri LaManno were tragically murdered in an act of hate at the Jewish Community Campus and Village Shalom in Overland Park, Kansas. SevenDays® was formed after this tragedy to combat hate and senseless violence crossing cultures, races, and religions.

Essays will be evaluated on the strength of the impact the project makes on the community, the creativity and/or originality of the project and the longevity of the project. Writing skills will be taken into account as they help convey the message effectively. For more information or to apply, please visit the scholarship provider's website.

To truly explore this question in an essay that is between 500 -800 words, you’ll need to go beyond "dictionary definitions," and express your understanding and reasoning about the connection between these two principles. This reasoning involves a combination of observation, experience, and some pretty "big ideas." What does it take to understand them? To build toward and maintain them? To see them with regard to each other? Why is this relationship important?
ADVERTISEMENT

We encourage you to bring emotion, creativity, specific examples, and well-researched facts into what you write. A good essay will demonstrate how equality and justice are not just abstract ideas but are part of the actions and choices of people every day.

We genuinely want to know how you would answer the question – what is the relationship between Equality and Justice?
