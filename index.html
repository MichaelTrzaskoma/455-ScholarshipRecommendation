		<!-- About Me -->
		<section class="about-me" id="about">

			<p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">About Scholar Seek</p>
			
			<div class="about-me__body">
                <p>We are a group of students at NYIT who feel like the college process is not as easy as it could be on new students. For new students the decisions they have to make are potentially life-altering and we think there aren't enough resources for them to handle it. Things like finding a major, picking which school to go to and finding a scholarship that can make college more affordable are important things that a new student will have to consider.</p>

                <p>Of course there are options to help these students along the way but they are few and far between, and usually specialize in only one aspect of the college decision making process. Furthermore, most students are unaware of these options and use of these services is hardly common place. Enter Scholar Seek, the one stop shop for all your college needs. We offer our custom surveys to students, collecting pertinent information about who they are, what they like, and what they want out of a college career, and the job that comes after it. We then are able to recommend scholarships that could help them pay for their higher education, by comparing their information to our large collection of scholarships we store. We also have surveys which will recommend which college or major a student would be best suited for based on factors like their GPA and SAT scores, interests and location preferences.</p>

                <p>Scholar Seek is not just for new students, existing students who may want a change in school, major or are just looking for another scholarship can get a lot of use out of Scholar Seek as well. We think that our app will help college students find their way much easier, and take a little bit of the strain off new students. We want to make things as easy as possible on new students, and so we've made our app simple to use, and as helpful as possible.</p>
